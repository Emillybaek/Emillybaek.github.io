Abstract
Whereas Lean Construction is a state-of-the-art practice in construction, associated simulation games in academic or professional education still rely on manual data input and analysis. Proposed is a digital learning platform that teaches the concept of lean construction using an active, hands-on serious gaming environment involving multiple players simultaneously in virtual reality. The novelty is to share rapid feedback with the participants while playing the game. Findings through testing demonstrate they benefit from the run-time data analysis and more effectively understand lean principles to eliminate waste, allow collaboration, and optimize quality in the value-added building chain.
