### Abstract
In  this study,  a  novel method  for  direct  work  estimation  is  used  to  classify  whether  a painteris performingdirect  workor  not.The  aim  is  to  build  an  accurate  and  reliable  work classification algorithmthatcanhelp monitorconstruction sites.The method utilizes adeep learning algorithmusing  convolutional  and  long  short-term  memory  layersto  classify  multivariate  time-series data collected from five inertial measurement units (IMUs)mounted on the workersâ€™arms, torso,and legs.Three models are developed, differing in window sizes from 3 seconds to 7 seconds.Thebest performingmodel achieves an accuracy of 90%and anF1-score of 87.6%. This is thefirst step towards a general model that  canclassify productivity measures for workers on construction sites, which will be a valuable input for monitoring construction sites and future analyses.
