### Abstract
n  this study,  a  novel method  for  direct  work  estimation  is  used  to  classify  whether  a painteris performingdirect  workor  not.The  aim  is  to  build  an  accurate  and  reliable  work classification algorithmthatcanhelp monitorconstruction sites.The method utilizes adeep learning algorithmusing  convolutional  and  long  short-term  memory  layersto  classify  multivariate  time-series data collected from five inertial measurement units (IMUs)mounted on the workers’arms, torso,and legs.Three models are developed, differing in window sizes from 3 seconds to 7 seconds.Thebest performingmodel achieves an accuracy of 90%and anF1-score of 87.6%. This is thefirst step towards a general model that  canclassify productivity measures for workers on construction sites, which will be a valuableinput formonitoringconstruction sitesandfuture analyses.1.IntroductionThe construction industryis very labor-intensive asitconsists of many manual tasks. Theability to monitor and manage both workers and activities can be an essential tool to ensure projects are withinthe scopeof time and cost. Several publications have over the last decadeshown the construction industry lacksbehind other industries in terms of productivity (Neve et al., 2020; Chapman  et  al.,  2010).  The  conclusions  vary  due  to  thecomplex nature  of  the  construction industry and the difficulty ofconsistentlymeasuring productivity. The methods used are easily biased and often lack continuity, only looking at small percentages of the construction projects’timespan.No  standardization  has  been  made  for  monitoring  productivity,  which  is  currently done on several levels, from project to task and worker levels.Therefore, developing methods that  allow  for  continuous  monitoring  of  construction  worker  productivity is necessaryto improveconstruction projects' performance.Productivity can beanintangible concept as different tasks requiredifferent actions;different tasks have different definitions of whetheran action is productive.In general,construction labor productivity (CLP) can be defined as the product output per person-hour worked.Several other factors are relevant when examiningproductivity,but as a measure of performance, CLP has been usedaloneas it isasignificantfactorfor the total project cost, as well as because it is the only factor that is conscious of its contribution(Wandahl et al., 2021).This paper (1) gives an overview of current activity recognition and productivity estimation researchin construction, (2)  introduces  a  deep  learning  method  for productivity  estimation,  (3)  shows the earlyimplementation  and  preliminary  resultsof  the  model,  and  (4)  discusses  the future  workregarding the method, the current challenges,and the potential.2.BackgroundCLPhas been extensively studied using manual methods, especially work sampling(Araujo et al., 2020; Wandahl et al., 2021; Gouett et al., 2011).Work sampling can be used to estimate CLP  due  to  the direct correlation  betweenthedirect work (DW) category “producing” and 418https://doi.org/10.7146/aul.455.c232
