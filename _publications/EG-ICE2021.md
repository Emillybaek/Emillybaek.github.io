#### Abstract
In this paper, a novel sensor system is used to detect worker presence near hazards and in
key locations tied to productivity through geo-fencing. The systems’ main component is real-time
monitoring via LiDAR, which allows for more precise detection of the workers’ position relative to
the locations. The method involves LiDAR change and use-time event detections. The system is
tested in a virtual environment resembling a real construction site, allowing for a safe evaluation
while initial results are produced. Preliminary findings demonstrate the usability and the potential
of this type of monitoring system, because of the precise detection of workers in geo-fenced
locations in general. It could potentially be incorporated into live construction work environments.
