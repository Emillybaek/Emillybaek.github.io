Course Objectives
======

To supply the students with a wide knowledge and prepare them for the use of remote sensing and data processing techniques in construction applications. This implies the ability to create data and develop digital building models, as carriers of project information for data extraction, exchange, and communication. Applications range from automated progress reporting to automation and robotics in construction. Training them in individual hands-on exercises and in team work.
