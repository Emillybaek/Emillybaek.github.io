I am a third year PhD Student in Civil and Architectural Engineering at Aarhus University. I work on easier ways to do construction labor productivity monitoring in the construction phase.

More specifically, my research focuses on multivariate timeseries classification and prediction to automate the monitoring of labor through kinematic data. I have experience in classification through deep learning, both for computer vision and tabular data, as well as timeseries forecasting using statistical methods. Furthermore, I have been part of several research projects within the field of VR for construction training. This both concerned safety but also LEAN principles. Besides my PhD project, I teach parts of two courses:  Advanced Technologies in Construction and Digital Construction, where my focus is on BIM and wearable sensors.

Before starting my PhD I did a MSc in Civil and Architectural Engineering (Aarhus University 2019-2022) as well as a BEng in Civil Engineering (Aarhus University 2015-2019). Alongside my education I have been working 3 years at [Exigo](https://exigoconsult.com/), specializing in Digital Construction.
