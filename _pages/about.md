I am a PhD Student at Aarhus University, at the department of Civil and Architectural Engineering. I am working with [Prof. Jochen Teizer](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/jochen-teizer(27a5770e-e88c-4af1-aba5-65a69a740b6e).html) in the research group [Construction Automation and Information Technologies](https://cae.au.dk/en/research/key-areas-in-research-and-development/design-and-construction/construction-automation-and-information-technologies).

I am interested in the interdisciplinary field of Civil Engineering and Computer Science. My PhD is focused on multivariate time series classification and forecasting to enable productivity estimations on construction sites.
I have a MSc in Civil and Architectural Engineering (Aarhus University 2019-2022) as well as a BEng in Civil Engineering (Aarhus University 2015-2019). Alongside my education I have been working 3 years at [Exigo](https://exigoconsult.com/), specializing in Digital Construction.
